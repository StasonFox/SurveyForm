# SurveyForm
#### Description: Second Responsive Web Design project from FreeCodeCamp: Building a Survey Form
This project is a survey form for beer, one of my favorite beverages. Homebrewing is also one of my favorite hobbies, so I figured beer was a good subject to base my project on. I included an orange bar at the top to mimic the color of beer. Multiple text fields are included as well as a drop-down menu, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a text box for comments and suggestions with a submit button.
